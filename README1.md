# PROJECT 1


 ### Discussion

In this prediction, we first analyzed the data to find that age, gender, class, and the number of spouses, children, and brothers are important factors for survival. Therefore, we conducted in-depth analysis to find out the rate of important factors affecting survival:

* Passengers under the age of 10 can survive

* First, second-class female passengers survive first.When the number of relatives was 0, the survival rate of third-class women was higher.

* Passengers between the ages of 20 and 45 have better survival rates

In contrast to this project, the decision tree algorithm is more accurate than the linear classifier.Through this project, I think that if we need to be more accurate, we can also choose random forest, KNN and other algorithms.
